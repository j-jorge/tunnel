Thank you for playing Tunnel. Here are some information you may find
interesting.

== System requirements ==

The game requires 30 Mo of free space on the hard disc to be
installed.

Running the game requires a hardware accelerated graphics card
supporting OpenGL 2.1 supporting fragment shaders, with at least 128 Mo
of memory. The game will consume something like 70 Mo of the main
system memory and should run well with a processor at 2 GHz.

The game runs with a resolution of 1280x720. You will need a keyboard to
play.

== Configuration ==

The default control keys are:

  - move left            => left arrow,
  - move right           => right arrow,
  - crouch/look downward => down arrow,
  - look upward          => up arrow,
  - jump                 => space,
  - teleport             => d.

These associations are saved after the first run of the game in the file

  \Documents and Settings\<username>\.tunnel\controller_layout_1

One can edit this file to change the keys for the future runs.

You can force the full screen (or windowed) mode by passing the
argument --fullscreen (respectively --windowed) to the program:

  <Install dir>\bin\tunnel.exe --fullscreen

The screen resolution can be forced with the --screen-width and
--screen-height arguments:

  <Install dir>\bin\tunnel.exe --screen-width=1024 --screen-height=600
 
== How to Play ==

As a novice God you have to pass a last exam before being able to
handle the creation and the being of the reality. This last test
consists into finding some crystals spread in the universes.

Use the arrow keys to progress in a universe. When you find a crystal,
walk over it to take it. Hold the "d" key to open a tunnel that will
bring you in another universe. When you have the specified amount of
crystals, find the exit and walk over it to leave the level.

== Magic Keys ==

 - F2 shows the FPS,
 - F5 takes a screenshot (saved in
   \Documents and Settings\<username>\.tunnel\),
 - F12 toggles the full screen mode on or off,
