If I knew there would be so many courses, I would not have chosen the God class. It's the first practicals and I'm already tired.


See who's coming. Looks like a moron.

Hello kid, I'm a guardian of the borders of the universes. I have been designated to be your mentor during these practicals.

See this machine? There is a similar one on every border of the universes.

We use them to preserve the global equilibrium. As you can see, they are powered by particular materials, and one of your goals as a god is to find these materials.

But be careful. As long as they run well, the global equilibrium is preserved. But if they ever stop, really bad things will happen. DON'T TOUCH THIS!
